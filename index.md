# What is SystemDocker?

SystemDocker is a set of utilities to help with the integration of services run within docker containers deployed on systems utilising the systemd init system. SystemDocker provides templates, style guidelines and drop-ins to help create consistent unit files for all docker containers that can integrate and work together. We will also maintain units and dropins for a selected number of docker images that will be hosted in the [SystemDocker GitHub account](https://github.com/SystemDocker) that are kept up to date with the latest design descisions made for the best practice of SystemDocker unit files.
